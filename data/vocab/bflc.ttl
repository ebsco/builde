# BIBFRAME Linked Data Extension aka BUILDE Relation üìñüîç

# This RDF vocabulary encompasses a wide range of classes and properties suitable for describing various
# types of bibliographic resources, scholarly works, and related entities. BUILDE includes a basic set of 
# core classes and properties known as the 'bflc' layer described here, as well as several extensions:

#	archive: things found in archives
#	rare books: things found in rare book libraries
#	scholar: things found in scholarly research and publishing
#	library: things found in libraries

# This vocabulary is ideal for librarians, information scientists, data curators, and developers working
# in academic and research settings. It can be employed in creating digital libraries, scholarly databases,
# cataloging systems, and other applications requiring structured bibliographic information.

# Key Features:
# - Compatibility with existing ontologies including Schema.org, SKOS, FOAF, and Dublin Core for enhanced interoperability.
# - Extension of BIBFRAME from the Library of Congress
# - Comprehensive coverage of bibliographic and scholarly domains.
# - Clear, self-explanatory labels and definitions for each class and property.
# - Hierarchical organization of classes using rdfs:subClassOf for structured representation.

# We encourage users to provide feedback and suggestions to continually improve and update this vocabulary.
# For versioning, updates, and more detailed documentation, please visit [https://bibfra.me/?].
